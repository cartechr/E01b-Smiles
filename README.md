    I have accomplished everything that I was told to accomplished
        1)I first edited main1.py so all of the different shapes and objects formed a smiley face. I also put the smiley face in the middle of the screen
        2)On main1.py everything moved when I edited the face_x and face_y values. To make the rest of the face you had to add or subtract values from the face_x and face_y.
        3)main3.py was the same thing as main2.py expect each of the parts of the face was given a specific label.
        4)On main4.py I edited the values of each part of the smiley face and then I messed around with the values on row 16 to see what they do.
